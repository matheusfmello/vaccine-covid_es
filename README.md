# Covid vaccination - ES/Brazil

Can we predict whether a person will take it's 2nd covid shot?

In this project we're using public information about people who took any covid shot in the Espirito Santo state, in Brazil for predicting whether any people in the dataset is going to take it's second shot properly or not.

Another dataset from IBGE was taken to enrich our data. We got information about scolarship, longevity, income and inequality in each patient's city for this purpose.

The functions script contains useful custom functions which helped tidying data at preprocessing stage.

This project's purpose is studying and developing myself as a data scientist, so I may upgrade the scripts in a while.

Datasets provided in this repository are a tiny representation of it's original datasets. URLs leading to the data sources containing the full datasets are shown below.
